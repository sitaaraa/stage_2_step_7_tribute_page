        <h3> As long as I can remember, books have been a vital part of my life, a way to escape to different worlds, to explore new frontiers, to comfort myself after a hard day, and constant companions through the vicissitudes of life.

        <p> My childhood bookshelves still exist, emptier than they once were, books from there having been scavenged for bookshelves elsewhere, or given away for other children to enjoy, but when I look at them, all my old favourites are still there, friends and joyful companions just waiting to leap from the pages and take me with them on a familiar adventure. Whether it’s my collection of late 19th - mid 20th Century Girls School Stories, the brightly coloured covers now sit in my rented flat, just waiting for me to dive into the 60+ books of the <i>Chalet School</i>. They are books which let me live in the world of a trilingual boarding school that moves from Austria to Guernsey in the beginning of WW2, and from there on to Herefordshire when the Nazis invade, then to an island off Wales, and eventually, to Switzerland. I can travel through Europe, feel the sadness and terror when fleeing from the Nazis, laugh at the hijinks of the naughty middles, and learn valuable lessons about compassion and seeing things from all sides.

         <p>I can reach to the shelves, and pick out my trilogy of the first <i>What Katy Did</i> books, the cover worn and falling off from the multiple reads and journeys across the country as I refused to be parted from it. As I run my fingers over the worn green, I’m flooded with memories, there’s me, nervous for an interview to change schools, holding the book that felt so much bigger then, to read while the head talked to my parents, the relief when the first thing she asked me was to tell her about my book - I talked about Katy in the first book, a rebellious tomboy and oldest child of 6, who when she breaks the rules, pays a heavy price, and for a long time is bedridden, and gradually learns to be welcoming and tidy, and the centre of the house. In the next book, I can follow her from a small town Midwestern home, to a boarding school in a city, far from home, there, I can learn the paper games she teaches her friends and play them, over a hundred years later, with my own friends, and even be reminded of the importance of values such as honesty and staying true to yourself. In the next, I get to travel around Europe in the 1880s, and discover what the countries were like prior to two wars ripping their way across the continent, I rediscover my own city and land through Katy and even new literature and classical texts through her own recollections of them. I thrill to the first stirrings of romance, when someone is able to see through the flashiness of one person to the steadfastness of another one.

        <p> A few shelves down, I can live in a world of time travelling angels, consider what happens after death, learn about new countries, imagine what it’s like to be in an entirely different time, and even get a new perspective on my own time and place. </p>

          <p> Over there are the sparkling covers of the <i>Stravaganza</i> series, their alternate Renaissance Italy punctuating my teenage years, as I imagined escaping my own reality, finding a token from another world, and then one day waking up in a world of magic and subterfuge, working with a secret society to overthrow the di Chimici family.

            <p> If we travel over to the “P”s, I can reach for Philip Pullman, <i>His Dark Materials</i> trilogy, books I reread over and over again in hospital as a teenager, them letting me travel away from the hospital beds, not only through streets I know so well in Oxford, but into new worlds of magic, witches, and armoured bears. I can be Lyra, running over the roofs of Oxford colleges, betrayed by both parents, bravely stepping forward into a new world, meeting Will, and by saving all the worlds, break my own heart. </p>

         <p> Over here is <i>The Children of the New Forest</i>, where I can roam the New Forest as a Cavalier or a Roundhead, sneaking through the words to poach deer from land that used to be my own, learning how to keep animals, imagining life under Oliver Cromwell, and the skirmishes of the English Civil War.

            <p> A bookcase across is <i>Ring Out Bow Bells!</i>, a portal into the 1400s, life as a Mercer apprentice in London under King Henry V, with Dick Whittington as Mayor. As an adult, I can walk the shadows of the streets of that long ago London, and imagine the sights and sounds of a city without cars, bridges covered with houses, and heads of traitors on pikes above London Bridge! </p> </div>

            <p> I could go on like this for much longer, about the books that have marked my life, and certainly not everyone is as lucky as I am to have had shelves and shelves filled with these wonderful transports to other times and places, but fortunately, the UK has wonderful public libraries (which are sadly under threat of cut budgets, closures, and lack of staff), which can provide those worlds for all children.
